ViSi-Genie-C-Library
==============================================================

C Library for 4D Systems ViSi-Genie Environment

## Information

This library provides high level functions for host controllers programmed in the C programming language, to ease communication with 4D Systems modules when using the module configured with ViSi-Genie.
Workshop4 PRO adds additional features to ViSi-Genie, allowing the User to write 4DGL code which can be executed at will from ViSi-Genie, enabling many advanced features not previously possible.
Please refer to the 4D Systems website, namingly the Workshop 4 Product Page, for documentation regarding Workshop 4, and its environments.

## Setup Instructions
The main library requires a couple of functions to be setup.

- unsigned long millis(void);    
    - returns the system time in milliseconds
- uint16_t genieGetByteCount(void);
    - returns the number of bytes present in the UART RX buffer
- uint8_t genieGetByte(void);
    - returns the next byte and take it out of the buffer
- uint8_t geniePeekByte(void);
    - returns the next byte and retain the current buffer    
- void geniePutByte(uint8_t);
    - sends a byte to the display module

## Example Demos

Inside the library are example demos for different Platforms/IDEs, to assist with getting started on using this library. Inside is also a ViSi-Genie Workshop4 project, which can be used on a range of 4D Systems displays (designed on a gen4-uLCD-32PT however can be changed via Workshop4 menu). It illustrates how to use some of the commands in the library include Read Object, Write Object, Reported Messages, Write Contrast and Write String.

## Tested with

This library has been tested on the STM32F030, however could easily be adapted (or may work as-is) to/with other MCU's running C 

If you've tested this library with other development platforms, please don't hesitate to notify us so we can update the compability list.

Any problems discovered with this library, please contact technical support from the 4D Sytems website so fixes can be put in place, or seek support from our forum.

## Compatible 4D Systems Display Modules

This library will work with all 4D Systems Modules which are capable of using the ViSi-Genie environment. This is therefore all Picaso, Diablo16, Pixxi-28 and Pixxi-44 Display Modules.
The demo included with this library was made for the uLCD-32PTU however can easily be adapted to other size displays.
